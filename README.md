I built a movie app where it uses a third-party API from the moviebd.org which has a giant database of movies with the title and ratings and images and whole bunch of data that we can work with. We used JavaScript to make a fetch request to get the data to show the most popular movies at the time. It will have a hover effect where it shows you the overview of each movie, shows you the rating. Also, special colours depending on what the rating is. For example, if its above 8, it Iâ€™ll be green. If it between 5 and 8 its orange and below 5 it red, also there is search functionality where you enter film name or word that belongs to a movie then it will fetch all the movies with that title or if it contains that title or key.
